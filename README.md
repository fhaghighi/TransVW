# Transferable Visual Words:  Exploiting the Semantics of Anatomical Patterns for Self-supervised Learning 

We have introduced a new concept called _<b>transferable visual words (TransVW)</b>_, where the sophisticated, consistent, and recurring anatomical patterns across medical images are natural *visual words*. These visual words, associated with rich *semantics* about the human anatomy, can be automatically extracted from unlabeled medical images and serve as strong yet free supervision signals for CNNs to learn generic semantics-enriched representation via self-supervision. TransVW is a fully autodidactic scheme (requiring no manual labeling), serves as an add-on strategy (boosting existing self-supervised methods), and yields semantics-enriched pre-trained models (saving annotation efforts for a variety of applications through transfer learning).
