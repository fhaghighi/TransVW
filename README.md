# Learning Semantics-enriched Representation via Self-discovery, Self-classification, and Self-restoration

<b>Semantic Genesis</b> is conceptually simple: an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections in between and a classification head at the end of the encoder. The objective for the model is to learn different sets of semantics-enriched representation from multiple perspectives. In doing so, our proposed framework consists of three important components: 
1. Self-discovery of anatomical patterns from similar patients
1. Self-classification of the patterns
1. Self-restoration of the transformed patterns

Specifically, once the self-discovered anatomical pattern set is built, we jointly train the classification and restoration branches together in the model.
